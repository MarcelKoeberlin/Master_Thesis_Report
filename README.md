This is my Master's Thesis report on my my topic "Shot Noise Measurements in High-Power Modelocked Thin-Disk Lasers" in Prof. Dr. Ursula Keller's Ultrafast Laser Physics group.
Abstract:

This thesis presents the design, construction, and characterization of a mode-
locked thin-disk laser (TDL) with an average output power of 60 W, a pulse
duration of 1030 fs, and a repetition rate of 19.7 MHz. Mode-locking is achieved
using a sapphire-bonded SESAM, and beam stabilization is implemented with
a two-actuator, two-detector system, reducing beam position fluctuations sig-
nificantly. The stabilized laser is input to a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre
(HCPCF). This results in a fibre coupling efficiency of 82% at 36 W input power.
Simulations of spectral broadening in the fibre are conducted, incorporating
fluctuations in average output power and pressure-dependent nonlinear refractive
indices, predicting a noise gain peak of 35 dB and a spectral broadening of 25 nm
FWHM. A grating spectrometer is also designed and built to achieve a wavelength
resolution of up to half a nanometer. Two silicon photodiodes are characterized,
and a comprehensive noise characterization is performed, measuring shot noise
at -162 dBc/Hz, limited by the photodiode.
Due to a gas leak in the pressure system, final noise measurements could
not be completed, but steps for future work are clearly outlined. After repairs
and final measurements are conducted, the project sets the stage for further
exploration, potentially achieving a record-low shot noise level of lower than -190 dBc/Hz.
